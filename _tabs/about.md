## About This Site ℹ️
Alongside my professional work, I actively pursue continuous learning through hands-on experimentation and technical research. This has led me to develop practical skills in secure network design, penetration testing, and adversarial thinking. This blog serves as a space to document technical write-ups and case studies that reflect how I approach security work in practice. The content emphasizes methodical analysis, clear communication of risk, and the connection between technical findings and real-world impact, rather than tool-driven walkthroughs or theoretical discussion."

## Background 💼
"I'm an IT security professional with over eight years of hands-on experience supporting and securing enterprise environments. My background includes building and maintaining resilient network architectures, conducting security audits, and supporting production systems with a strong focus on risk reduction and operational stability."

### Technical Focus

- Network and infrastructure security
- Penetration testing and attack surface analysis
